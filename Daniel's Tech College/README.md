## Reasons to Avoid Table-based Layouts

### 1. Semantics
Tables should be used for tabular data, not for structuring layouts. This practice leads to poor semantic structure, affecting SEO and accessibility.

### 2. Flexibility and Responsiveness
Table-based layouts tend to be less adaptable to various screen sizes or devices, causing usability issues, especially on mobile devices.

### 3. Complexity and Maintenance
Maintaining table-based layouts can result in complex and error-prone code, making it harder to modify or update the website structure.

### 4. Performance
Overusing tables can impact page performance, leading to slower loading times, especially on devices with limited resources.

## Preferred Approach
Instead of tables, using semantic HTML elements combined with CSS for styling is recommended for creating well-structured, responsive, and accessible web layouts.
