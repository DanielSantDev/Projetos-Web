<!-- PAY ATTENTION

This project has educational purposes with HTML. Using tables in HTML to structure web pages was a common practice in the past, especially for layout design. However, it's not recommended for a few reasons:

Semantics: Tables are meant for tabular data, not layout structuring. Using tables for layout purposes leads to poor semantic structure, making it harder for search engines to understand the content and impairing accessibility for users who rely on screen readers.

Flexibility and Responsiveness: Table-based layouts tend to be less flexible and responsive. They don't adapt well to different screen sizes or devices, causing usability issues for mobile users and those on various screen resolutions.

Complexity and Maintenance: Tables for layout can result in more complex and harder-to-maintain code. Modifying the structure becomes cumbersome and error-prone, leading to difficulties in maintaining the website.

Performance: Overusing tables can impact page performance, causing slower loading times, especially on devices with limited resources or slower connections.

Instead of tables, using semantic HTML elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, combined with CSS for styling, is recommended for creating well-structured, responsive, and accessible web layouts. This approach provides a clearer structure, easier maintenance, and better user experiences across different devices.
